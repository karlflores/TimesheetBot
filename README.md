# TimesheetBot
Discord Timesheet Bot for AusDOJ FiveM Server. This records the patrol hours completed by RP popo. 

Currently interfaces with a MongoDB backend storing each of the incoming messages. Users are able to edit and delete messages as long as the bot is running. 

Administrators are able to update the database by crawling through the chat logs of a specific text channel.
